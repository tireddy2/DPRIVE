    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies mechanisms to automatically bootstrap
      endpoints (e.g., hosts, Customer Equipment) to discover and authenticate
      DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by a local
      network.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise, secure
      home and wall-gardened networks to protect endpoints (e.g,. hosts, IoT
      devices). Some of these security services act on DNS requests from
      endpoints. However, if an endpoint is configured to use public
      DNS-over-(D)TLS <xref target="RFC7858"></xref> <xref
      target="RFC8094"></xref> or DNS-over-HTTPS <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> servers, network security services in the local
      network cannot act efficiently on DNS requests from the endpoints. In
      order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network security services
      can block DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic by dropping outgoing packets to
      destination port 853, and by identifying the domains offering
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers, DNS-over-HTTPS traffic can be blocked by
      dropping outgoing packets to these domains. If the endpoint has enabled
      strict privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>),
      and the network security service blocks the traffic to the public DNS
      server, DNS service is not available to the endpoint and ultimately the
      endpoint cannot access Internet. If the endpoint has enabled
      opportunistic privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the network security service blocks
      traffic to the public DNS server, the endpoint will either fallback to
      an encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS-over-(D)TLS
      server provided by the local network or fallback to clear text DNS, and
      cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages. This can compromise the endpoint
      security and privacy; some of the potential security threats are listed
      below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.</t>

          <t>If the endpoint is an IoT device which is configured to use
          public DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and if a policy
          enforcement point in the local network is programmed using a
          Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) file <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud"></xref> by a MUD manager to only allow
          intented communications to and from the IoT device, the policy
          enforcement point cannot enforce the Network Access Control List
          rules based on domain names (Section 8 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud"></xref>).</t>

          <t>The network security service cannot prevent an endpoint from
          accessing malicious domains. Attacks like DNS cache poisoning can
          lead the user to visit malicious website to inject malware on the
          endpoint. For instance, malwares like DNSChanger can modify the
          endpoint's DNS entries to point toward its own rogue name servers
          which then injected its own advertising into Web pages.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DPRIVE and DoH working groups have not defined an automated
      mechanism to securely bootstrap the endpoints to discover and
      authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers in the local
      network. Some clients have pre-configured specific public DNS servers
      (such as Mozilla using Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS server). If endpoints
      continue to use hard-coded public DNS servers, this has a risk of
      relying on few centralized DNS services. Content Delivery Networks
      (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS may lose the ability to direct
      end-user traffic to a nearby cluster in cases where a DNS service is
      being used that is not affiliated with the local network and which does
      not send "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS) information to the CDN's DNS
      authorities <xref target="CDN"></xref>. If a local DNS server is not
      used for DNS resolution, "Split DNS" <xref target="RFC2775"></xref> to
      use the special internal-only domain names in enterprise networks will
      not work, and ".local" and "home.arpa" names cannot be locally resolved
      in home networks.</t>

      <t>The document proposes a mechanism to automatically bootstrap the
      endpoints to discover and authenticate the DNS-over-(D)TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the local network. The overall
      procedure can be structured into the following steps:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Bootstrapping phase (<xref target="bootstrap-iot"></xref> and
          <xref target="bootstrap-endpoint"></xref>) is meant to automatically
          bootstrap endpoints with local network's CA certificates and DNS
          server certificate.</t>

          <t>Discovery phase (<xref target="discovery"></xref>) is meant to
          discover the privacy-enabling protocols supported by the DNS server
          and usable DNS server IP addresses and port numbers.</t>

          <t>Connection handshake and service invocation: The DNS client
          initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server learned in the
          discovery phase. Furthermore, DNS client uses the credentials
          discovered during the bootstrapping phase to validate the server
          certificate.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note: The strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in
      <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> only applies to DNS-over-(D)TLS
      protocols, there has been no such distinction made for DNS-over-HTTPS
      protocol. </t>

          specifies means to provision credentials on devices to be used to
          operationally access networks. In addition, BRSKI provides an
          automated mechanism for the bootstrap distribution of CA

      <t>The following steps explain the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
      an endpoint with the local network's CA certificates and DNS server
      certificate: <list style="numbers">
          <t>The endpoint authenticates to the local network and establishes
          provisional TLS connection with the registrar operating as the

          Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The endpoint uses Salted Challenge Response Authentication
          Mechanism (SCRAM) <xref target="RFC7804"></xref> to perform mutual

          a more robust authentication mechanism than a plaintext password
          protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).</t>

          <t>If the BRSKI-EST server authentication is successful, the
          endpoint requests the full EST distribution of current CA

          verified using the CA certificates downloaded, the TLS connection is
          immediately discarded and the endpoint abandons the attempt to
          bootstrap from the BRSKI-EST server and discards the CA certificates
          conveyed by the BRSKI-EST server. The endpoint stores the CA
          certificates as Explicit Trust Anchor database entries. The endpoint
          uses the Explicit Trust Anchor database to validate the DNS server
          certificate. The endpoint needs to perform SCRAM authentication the
          first time it connects BRSKI-EST server. On subsequent connections
          to the BRSKI-EST server, the endpoint can validate the BRSKI-EST

          <t>The DNS client then uses the authentication domain name for

      <section anchor="srvr" title="Resolution">
        <t>Once the DNS client has retrieved the authentication domain name
        for the DNS server, an S-NAPTR lookup with 'DPRIVE' application
        service and the desired protocol tag is made to obtain information
        necessary to securely connect to the DNS server. The S-NAPTR lookup is
        performed using an untrusted recursive DNS resolver from an untrusted
        source (such as DHCP).</t>

        <t>This specification defines "DPRIVE" as an application service tag

        <t>If no DNS-specific S-NAPTR records can be retrieved, the discovery

        retrying a lookup that has failed, a DNS client MUST wait a time
        period that is appropriate for the encountered error (e.g., NXDOMAIN,

    <section anchor="auth" title="Connection handshake and service invocation">
      <t>The DNS client initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server, the

      <t>If the match is successful and server certificate is successfully
      validated, the client continues with the connection as normal.
      Otherwise, the client MUST treat the server certificate validation
      failure as a non-recoverable error. If the DNS client cannot reach or
      establish an authenticated and encrypted connection with the
      privacy-enabling DNS server provided by the local network, the DNS

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The bootstrapping procedure to discover and authenticate
      DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS Servers MUST be enabled by the
      endpoint in a trusted network (e.g. Enterprise, Secure home networks)
      and disabled in a untrusted network (e.g. public WiFi network), similar
      to the way VPN connection from the endpoint to a VPN gateway is
      disconnected in a trusted network and VPN connection is established in a
      untrusted network.</t>

      <t>If the endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile, and the network
      security service blocks the traffic to the privacy-enabling public DNS
      server, a hard failure occurs and the user is notified. The user has a
      choice to switch to another network or if the user trusts the network,
      the user can enable strict privacy profile with the DNS-over-(D)TLS or
      DNS-over-HTTPS server discovered in the network instead of downgrading
      to opportunistic privacy profile.</t>

      <t>The primary attacks against the methods described in <xref
      target="discovery"></xref> are the ones that would lead to impersonation
      of a DNS server and spoofing the DNS response to indicate that the DNS
      server does not support any privacy-enabling protocols. To protect
      against DNS-vectored attacks, secured DNS (DNSSEC) can be used to ensure
      the validity of the DNS records received. The explicit trust anchor
      database entries downloaded in step 3 in <xref
      target="bootstrap-iot"></xref> and <xref
      target="bootstrap-endpoint"></xref> can be used by the endpoint to
      validate the DNSSEC signature. Impersonation of the DNS server is
      prevented by validating the certificate presented by the DNS server. If
      the BRSKI-EST server conveys the DNS server certificate, but the S-NAPTR
      lookup indicates that the DNS server does not support any
      privacy-enabling protocols, the client can detect the DNS response is
      spoofed. </t>
