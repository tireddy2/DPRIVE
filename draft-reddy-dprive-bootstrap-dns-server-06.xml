      <t>This document specifies mechanisms to automatically bootstrap
      endpoints (e.g., hosts, Customer Equipment) to discover and authenticate
      DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by a local

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Traditionally a caching DNS server has been provided by local
      networks. This provides benefits such as low latency to reach that DNS
      server (owing to its network proximity to the endpoint). However, if an
      endpoint is configured to use Internet-hosted or public DNS-over-(D)TLS
      <xref target="RFC7858"></xref> <xref target="RFC8094"></xref> or
      DNS-over-HTTPS <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> servers, any available
      local DNS server cannot serve DNS requests from local endpoints. If
      public DNS servers are used instead of using local DNS servers, some
      operational problems can occur such as those listed below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>"Split DNS" <xref target="RFC2775"></xref> to use the special
          internal-only domain names (e.g., "internal.example.com") in
          enterprise networks will not work, and ".local" and "home.arpa"
          names cannot be locally resolved in home networks.</t>

          <t>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS
          may lose the ability to direct end-user traffic to a nearby
          service-specific cluster in cases where a DNS service is being used
          that is not affiliated with the local network and which does not
          send "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS) information <xref
          target="RFC7871"></xref> to the CDN's DNS authorities <xref
          target="CDN"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If public DNS servers are used instead of using local DNS servers,
      the following discusses the impact on network-based security:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
          networks to protect endpoints (e.g,. Hosts, IoT devices).
          Network-based security solutions such as Firewalls (FW) and
          Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic
          inspection to implement perimeter-based security policies. The
          network security services may for example prevent malware download,
          block known malicious URLs, enforce use of strong ciphers, stop data
          exfiltration, etc. These network security services act on DNS
          requests originating from endpoints.</t>

          <t>However, if an endpoint is configured to use public
          DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS servers, network security services
          cannot act on DNS requests from these endpoints.</t>

          <t>In order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network security
          services can block DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic by dropping outgoing
          packets to destination port 853. Identifying DNS-over-HTTPS traffic
          is far more challenging than DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic. Network
          security services may try to identify the domains offering
          DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and DNS-over-HTTPS traffic can be blocked by
          dropping outgoing packets to these domains. If an endpoint has
          enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref
          target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the network security service blocks
          the traffic to the public DNS server, the DNS service won't be
          available to the endpoint and ultimately the endpoint cannot access
          Internet-reachable services.</t>

          <t>If an endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile (Section
          5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the network security
          service blocks traffic to the public DNS server, the endpoint will
          either fallback to an encrypted connection without authenticating
          the DNS server provided by the local network or fallback to clear
          text DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the network security service fails to block DNS-over-(D)TLS or
      DNS-over-HTTPS traffic, this can compromise the endpoint security; some
      of the potential security threats are listed below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The network security service cannot prevent an endpoint from
          accessing malicious domains.</t>

          <t>If the endpoint is an IoT device which is configured to use
          public DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and if a policy
          enforcement point in the local network is programmed using, for
          example, a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) file <xref
          target="RFC8520"></xref> by a MUD manager to only allow intented
          communications to and from the IoT device, the policy enforcement
          point cannot enforce the network Access Control List (ACL) rules
          based on domain names (Section 8 of <xref
          target="RFC8520"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the network security service successfully blocks DNS-over-(D)TLS
      and DNS-over-HTTPS traffic, this can still compromise the endpoint
      security and privacy; some of the potential security threats are listed
      below:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.</t>

          <t>An internal attacker can modify the DNS responses to re-direct
          the client to malicious servers.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In addition, the local network's DNS server is advertised using
      DHCP/RA which is insecure and also provides no mechanism to securely
      authenticate the DNS server. To overcome the above threats, this
      document specifies a mechanism to automatically bootstrap endpoints to
      discover and authenticate the DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers
      provided by their local network. The overall procedure can be structured
      into the following steps:<list style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="bootstrap-endpoint">Bootstrapping</xref> is
          necessary only when connecting to a new network or when the
          network's DNS certificate has changed. Bootstrapping authenticates
          the Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref
          target="RFC7030"></xref> server to the endpoint. After
          authenticating the EST server, DNS server certificate used by the
          local network is downloaded to the endpoint. This DNS server
          certificate enables subsequent authenticated encrypted communication
          with the local DNS server (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS) during in the
          connection phase.</t>

          <t><xref target="discovery">Discovery</xref> is performed by a
          previously bootstrapped endpoint whenever connecting to a network.
          During discovery, the endpoint is instructed which privacy-enabling
          DNS protocol(s), port number(s), and IP addresses are supported on a
          local network. This effectively takes the place of DNS server IP
          address traditionally provided by IPv4 or IPv6 DHCP or by <xref
          target="RFC8106">IPv6 Router Advertisement</xref>.</t>

          <t><xref target="auth">Connection handshake and service
          invocation</xref>: The DNS client initiates a (D)TLS handshake with
          the DNS server learned in the discovery phase, and validates the DNS
          server's identity using the credentials obtained in the
          bootstrapping phase.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note: The strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in
      <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> only applies to DNS-over-(D)TLS
      protocols, there has been no such distinction made for DNS-over-HTTPS
      protocol.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="scope" title="Scope">
      <t>The problems discussed in <xref target="intro"></xref> will be
      encountered in Enterprise networks. Typically Enterprise networks do not
      assume that all devices in their network are managed by the IT team or
      Mobile Device Management (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common
      BYOD ("Bring Your Own Device") scenario. The mechanisms specified in
      this document can be used by BYOD devices to discover and authenticate
      DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the Enterprise
      network. This mechanism can also be used by IoT devices (managed by IT
      team) after onboarding to discover and authenticate DNS- over-(D)TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the Enterprise network.</t>

      <t>WiFi as frequently deployed is vulnerable to various attacks (<xref
      target="Evil-Twin"></xref>,<xref target="Krack"> </xref> and <xref
      target="Dragonblood"></xref>). Because of these attacks, only
      cryptographically authenticated communications are trusted on WiFi
      networks. This means information provided by the network via DHCPv4,
      DHCPv6, or RA (e.g., NTP server, DNS server, default domain) are
      un-trusted because DHCP and RA are not authenticated.</t>

      <t>The users have to indicate to their system in some way that they
      desire bootstrapping to be performed only when connecting to a specific
      network (e.g., organization for which a user works or a user works
      temporarily within another corporation), similar to the way users
      disable VPN connection in specific network (e.g., Enterprise network)
      and enable VPN connection by default in other networks. If the
      discovered DNS server meets the privacy preserving data policy
      requirements of the user, the user can select to use the discovered
      DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers. In addition, if the
      discovered DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers are reachable on
      the Internet, user can inform the system to use the servers in other
      networks. It is strongly recommended to configure the DNS server to be
      used in other networks provided the DNS server meets the privacy
      preserving data policy requirements of the user and offers malware
      filtering service. </t>

      <t>If the device joins a public WiFi without any security credential
      verification or joins a WiFi using a single shared password among all
      the attached devices, such networks are typically not known to the user
      or a compromised devices can spoof the access point or the attacker can
      host a fake access point, and the device cannot be securely bootstrapped
      with the network's DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS server. A compromised
      device may, for example, expose to an attacker secrets (such as single
      shared password) stored in the device. Such networks can also be
      misconfigured or malicious. Further, the client cannot know if the
      discovered DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-(D)TLS server is hosted by the
      network operator or by an attacker. In such networks, DNS-over-HTTPS and
      DNS-over-(D)TLS server discovered using insecure discovery mechanisms
      like DHCP can be used by the client if and only if the insecurely
      discovered DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-(D)TLS server is previously
      securely discovered in a different network, offers malware filtering
      service, meets the privacy preserving data policy requirements of the
      user and configured to be used in other networks.</t>

             title="Bootstrapping Endpoint Devices">
      <t>The following steps detail the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
      an endpoint with the local network's DNS server certificate: <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>The endpoint authenticates to the local network and discovers the
          Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref
          target="RFC7030"></xref> server using the procedure discussed in
          <xref target="EST_Discovery"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The endpoint establishes provisional TLS connection with that EST
          server, i.e., the endpoint provisionally accepts the unverified TLS
          server certificate. However, the endpoint MUST authenticate the EST
          server before it accepts the DNS server certificate. The endpoint
          either uses password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) with
          TLS 1.3 <xref target="I-D.barnes-tls-pake"></xref> as an
          authentication method or uses the mutual authentication protocol for
          HTTP <xref target="RFC8120"> </xref> to authenticate the discovered
          EST server. <vspace blankLines="1" />As a reminder, PAKE is an
          authentication method that allows the use of usernames and passwords
          over unencrypted channels without revealing the passwords to an
          eavesdropper. Similarly, the mutual authentication for HTTP is based
          on PAKE and provides mutual authentication between an HTTP client
          and an HTTP server using username and password as credentials. The
          cryptographic algorithms to use with the mutual authentication
          protocol for HTTP are defined in <xref target="RFC8121"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The endpoint needs to use PAKE scheme to perform authentication
          the first time it connects to an EST server. If the EST server
          authentication is successful, the server's identity can be used to
          authenticate subsequent TLS connections to that EST server. The
          endpoint configures the reference identifier for the EST server
          using the DNS-ID identifier type in the EST server certificate. On
          subsequent connections to the EST server, the endpoint MUST validate
          the EST server certificate using the Implict Trust Anchor database
          (i.e, the EST server certificate must pass PKIX certification path
          validation) and match the reference identifier against the EST
          server's identity according to the rules specified in Section 6.4 of
          <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The endpoint learns the End-Entity certificates <xref
          target="RFC8295"></xref> from the EST server. The certificate
          provisioned to the DNS server in the local network will be treated
          as a End-Entity certificate. As a reminder, the End-Entity
          certificates must be validated by the endpoint using an authorized
          trust anchor (Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8295"></xref>). The
          endpoint needs to identify the certificate provisioned to the DNS
          server. The SRV-ID identifier type <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>
          within subjectAltName entry MUST be used to identify the DNS server
          certificate. <vspace blankLines="1" />For example, DNS server
          certificate will include SRV-ID "_domain-s.example.net" along with
          DNS-ID "example.net". The SRV service label "domain-s" is defined in
          Section 6 of <xref target="RFC7858"></xref>. As a reminder, the
          protocol component is not included in the SRV-ID <xref
          target="RFC4985"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The endpoint configures the authentication domain name (ADN)
          (defined in <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>) for the DNS server from
          the DNS-ID identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the DNS
          server certificate. The DNS server certificate is associated with
          the ADN to be matched with the certificate given by the DNS server
          in (D)TLS. To some extent, this approach is similar to certificate
          usage PKIX-EE(1) defined in <xref target="RFC7671"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The following steps explain the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
      IoT devices with local network's CA certificates and DNS server
      certificate: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) discussed
          in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref>
          provides a solution for secure automated bootstrap of devices. BRSKI
          specifies means to provision credentials on devices to be used to
          operationally access networks. In addition, BRSKI provides an
          automated mechanism for the bootstrap distribution of CA
          certificates from the EST server. The IoT device can use BRSKI to
          automatically bootstrap the IoT device using the IoT manufacturer
          provisioned X.509 certificate, in combination with a registrar
          provided by the local network and IoT device manufacturer's
          authorizing service (MASA):<list style="numbers">
              <t>The IoT device authenticates to the local network using the
              IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509 certificate. The IoT device
              can request and get a voucher from the MASA service via the
              registrar. The voucher is signed by the MASA service and
              includes the local network's CA public key.</t>

              <t>The IoT device validates the signed voucher using the
              manufacturer installed trust anchor associated with the MASA,
              stores the CA's public key and validates the provisional TLS
              connection to the registrar.</t>

              <t>The IoT device requests the full EST distribution of current
              CA certificates (Section 5.9.1 in <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref>) from the
              registrar operating as a BRSKI-EST server. The IoT devices
              stores the CA certificates as Explicit Trust Anchor database
              entries. The IoT device uses the Explicit Trust Anchor database
              to validate the DNS server certificate.</t>

              <t>The IoT device learns the End-Entity certificates from the
              BRSKI-EST server. The certificate provisioned to the DNS server
              in the local network will be treated as an End-Entity
              certificate. The IoT device needs to identify the certificate
              provisioned to the DNS server. The SRV-ID identifier type within
              subjectAltName entry MUST be used to identify the DNS server
              certificate.</t>

              <t>The endpoint configures the ADN for the DNS server from the
              DNS-ID identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the DNS
              server certificate. The DNS server certificate is associated
              with the ADN to be matched with the certificate given by the DNS
              server in (D)TLS.</t>

    <section anchor="discovery"
             title="DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS Server Discovery Procedure">
      <t>A DNS client discovers the DNS server in the local network supporting
      DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols by using
      DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) <xref target="RFC6763"></xref>.
      DNS-SD provides generic solution for discovering services available in a
      local network. DNS-SD defines a set of naming rules for certain DNS
      record types that they use for advertising and discovering services.
      Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC6763"></xref> specifies that a service
      instance name in DNS-SD has the following structure:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[<Instance> . <Service> . <Domain>]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t></t>

      <t>The &lt;Domain&gt; portion specifies the authentication domain name.
      The &lt;Service&gt; portion of the DNS service instance name MUST be
      "_dprive._udp" or "_dprive._tcp" or "_doh._tcp". If no DNS-SD records
      can be retrieved, the discovery procedure fails for this authentication
      domain name. However, before retrying a lookup that has failed, a DNS
      client MUST wait a time period that is appropriate for the encountered
      error (e.g., NXDOMAIN, timeout, etc.). If no DNS-SD records can be
      retrieved, the client can try connecting to the pre-configured public
      DNS servers. If the endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile and
      access to the pre-configured public DNS servers is blocked, the DNS
      service won't be available to the endpoint and ultimately the endpoint
      cannot access Internet-reachable services. If the endpoint has enabled
      opportunistic privacy profile and access to the pre-configured public
      DNS servers is blocked, the endpoint will either fallback to an
      encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS server provided by
      the local network or fallback to clear text DNS.</t>

      <t>If DNS-over-HTTPS protocol is supported by the DNS server, the DNS
      client can query for the URI resource record type <xref
      target="RFC7553"></xref> to use the https URI scheme (Section 3 of <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref>).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="auth" title="Connection Handshake and Service Invocation">
      <t>The DNS client initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server, the
      DNS server presents its certificate in ServerHello message, and the DNS
      client MUST match the DNS server certificate downloaded in Step 4 in
      <xref target="bootstrap-endpoint"></xref> or <xref
      target="bootstrap-iot"></xref> with the certificate provided by the DNS
      server in (D)TLS handshake. If the match is successful, the DNS client
      MUST validate the server certificate using the Implicit Trust Anchor
      database (i.e., the DNS server certificate must pass PKIX certification
      path validation).</t>

      <t>If the match is successful and server certificate is successfully
      validated, the client continues with the connection as normal.
      Otherwise, the client MUST treat the server certificate validation
      failure as a non-recoverable error. If the DNS client cannot reach or
      establish an authenticated and encrypted connection with the
      privacy-enabling DNS server provided by the local network, the DNS
      client can fallback to the privacy-enabling public DNS server.</t>

    <section anchor="EST_Discovery" title="EST Service Discovery Procedure">
      <t>A EST client discovers the EST server in the local network by using
      DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) <xref target="RFC6763"></xref> or
      Multicast DNS (mDNS) <xref target="RFC6762"></xref>. The &lt;Domain&gt;
      portion specifies the DNS sub-domain where the service instance is
      registered. It may be "local.", indicating the mDNS local domain, or it
      may be a conventional domain name such as "example.com.". The
      &lt;Service&gt; portion of the EST service instance name MUST be
      "_est._tcp".</t>

      <section title="mDNS">
        <t>A EST client application can proactively discover an EST server
        being advertised in the site by multicasting a PTR query to the

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>"_est._tcp.local"</t>
          </list>A EST server can send out gratuitous multicast DNS answer
        packets whenever it starts up, wakes from sleep, or detects a change
        in EST server configuration. EST client application can receive these
        gratuitous packets and cache information contained in them.</t>

    <section anchor="reattach" title="Network Reattachment">
      <t>On subsequent attachments to the network, the endpoint discovers the
      privacy-enabling DNS server using the authentication domain name
      (configured in Step 5 of <xref target="bootstrap-endpoint"></xref> or
      <xref target="bootstrap-iot"></xref>), initiates (D)TLS handshake with
      the DNS server and follows the mechanism discussed in <xref
      target="auth"></xref> to validate the DNS server certificate.</t>

      <t>If the DNS server certificate is invalid (e.g., revoked or expired)
      or the procedure to discover the privacy-enabling DNS server fails (e.g.
      the domain name of the privacy-enabling DNS server has changed because
      the Enterprise network has switched to a public privacy-enabling DNS
      server capable of blocking access to malicious domains), the endpoint
      discovers and initiates TLS handshake with the EST server, and uses the
      validation techniques described in <xref target="RFC6125"></xref> to
      compare the reference identifier (created in Step 2 of <xref
      target="bootstrap-endpoint"></xref> in this document) to the EST server
      certificate and verifies the entire certification path as per <xref
      target="RFC5280"></xref>. The endpoint then gets the DNS server
      certificate from the EST server. If the DNS-ID identifier type within
      subjectAltName entry in the DNS server certificate does not match the
      configured ADN, the ADN is replaced with the DNS-ID identifier type. The
      DNS server certificate associated with the ADN is replaced with the one
      provided by the EST server. If the ADN has changed, the endpoint
      discovers the privacy-enabling DNS server, initiates (D)TLS handshake
      with the DNS server and follows the mechanism discussed in <xref
      target="auth"></xref> to validate the DNS server certificate.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC7626"></xref> discusses DNS privacy considerations
      in both "on the wire" (Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>)
      and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>
      contexts. The mechanism defined in
      [I-D.reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy] can be used by the client to
      discover the privacy policy information of the DNS server.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The bootstrapping procedure to obtain the certificate of the local
      networks DNS server uses a client identity and password to authenticate
      the EST server using PAKE schemes. Security considerations such as those
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.barnes-tls-pake"></xref> or <xref
      target="RFC8120"></xref> and <xref target="RFC8121"></xref> need to be
      taken into consideration.</t>

      <t>Users cannot be expected to enable or disable the bootstrapping or
      the discovery procedure as they switch networks. Thus, it is RECOMMENDED
      that users indicate to their system in some way that they desire
      bootstrapping to be performed when connecting to a specific network,
      similar to the way users disable VPN connection in specific network
      (e.g., Enterprise network) and enable VPN connection by default in other
      networks.</t>

      <t>If an endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile, and the network
      security service blocks the traffic to the privacy-enabling public DNS
      server, a hard failure occurs and the user is notified. The user has a
      choice to switch to another network or if the user trusts the network,
      the user can enable strict privacy profile with the DNS-over-(D)TLS or
      DNS-over-HTTPS server discovered in the network instead of downgrading
      to opportunistic privacy profile.</t>

      <t>The primary attacks against the methods described in <xref
      target="discovery"></xref> are the ones that would lead to impersonation
      of a DNS server and spoofing the DNS response to indicate that the DNS
      server does not support any privacy-enabling protocols. To protect
      against DNS-vectored attacks, secured DNS (DNSSEC) can be used to ensure
      the validity of the DNS records received. Impersonation of the DNS
      server is prevented by validating the certificate presented by the DNS
      server. If the EST server conveys the DNS server certificate, but the
      DNS-SD lookup indicates that the DNS server does not support any
      privacy-enabling protocols, the client can detect the DNS response is
      spoofed.</t>

      <t>Security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref> need to be taken
      into consideration for IoT devices.</t>
