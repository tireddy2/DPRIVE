1.  Introduction

   Traditionally a caching DNS server has been provided by local
   networks.  This provides benefits such as low latency to reach that
   DNS server (owing to its network proximity to the endpoint).
   However, if an endpoint is configured to use Internet-hosted or
   public DNS-over-(D)TLS [RFC7858] [RFC8094] or DNS-over-HTTPS
   [RFC8484] servers, any available local DNS server cannot serve DNS
   requests from local endpoints.  If public DNS servers are used
   instead of using local DNS servers, some operational problems can
   occur such as those listed below:

   o  "Split DNS" [RFC2775] to use the special internal-only domain
      names (e.g., "internal.example.com") in enterprise networks will
      not work, and ".local" and "home.arpa" names cannot be locally
      resolved in home networks.

   o  Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS may
      lose the ability to direct end-user traffic to a nearby service-
      specific cluster in cases where a DNS service is being used that
      is not affiliated with the local network and which does not send

      "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS) information [RFC7871] to the CDN's DNS
      authorities [CDN].

   If public DNS servers are used instead of using local DNS servers,
   the following discusses the impact on network-based security:

   o  Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
      networks to protect endpoints (e.g,. Hosts, IoT devices).
      Network-based security solutions such as Firewalls (FW) and
      Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic
      inspection to implement perimeter-based security policies.  The
      network security services may for example prevent malware
      download, block known malicious URLs, enforce use of strong
      ciphers, stop data exfiltration, etc.  These network security
      services act on DNS requests originating from endpoints.

   o  However, if an endpoint is configured to use public DNS-
      over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS servers, network security services
      cannot act on DNS requests from these endpoints.

   o  In order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network security
      services can block DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic by dropping outgoing
      packets to destination port 853.  Identifying DNS-over-HTTPS
      traffic is far more challenging than DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic.
      Network security services may try to identify the domains offering
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and DNS-over-HTTPS traffic can be blocked
      by dropping outgoing packets to these domains.  If an endpoint has
      enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of [RFC8310]), and the
      network security service blocks the traffic to the public DNS
      server, the DNS service won't be available to the endpoint and
      ultimately the endpoint cannot access Internet-reachable services.

   o  If an endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile
      (Section 5 of [RFC8310]), and the network security service blocks
      traffic to the public DNS server, the endpoint will either
      fallback to an encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS
      server provided by the local network or fallback to clear text
      DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.

   If the network security service fails to block DNS-over-(D)TLS or
   DNS-over-HTTPS traffic, this can compromise the endpoint security;
   some of the potential security threats are listed below:

   o  The network security service cannot prevent an endpoint from
      accessing malicious domains.

   o  If the endpoint is an IoT device which is configured to use public
      DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and if a policy

      enforcement point in the local network is programmed using, for
      example, a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) file [RFC8520] by
      a MUD manager to only allow intented communications to and from
      the IoT device, the policy enforcement point cannot enforce the
      network Access Control List (ACL) rules based on domain names
      (Section 8 of [RFC8520]).

   If the network security service successfully blocks DNS-over-(D)TLS
   and DNS-over-HTTPS traffic, this can still compromise the endpoint
   security and privacy; some of the potential security threats are
   listed below:

   o  Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.

   o  An internal attacker can modify the DNS responses to re-direct the
      client to malicious servers.

   To overcome the above threats, this document specifies a mechanism to
   automatically bootstrap endpoints to discover and authenticate the
   DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by their local
   network.  The overall procedure can be structured into the following
   steps:

   o  Bootstrapping (Section 4) is necessary only when connecting to a
      new network or when the network's DNS certificate has changed.
      Bootstrapping authenticates the Enrollment over Secure Transport
      (EST) [RFC7030] server to the endpoint.  After authenticating the
      EST server, DNS server certificate used by the local network is
      downloaded to the endpoint.  This DNS server certificate enables
      subsequent authenticated encrypted communication with the local
      DNS server (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS) during in the connection phase.

   o  Discovery (Section 6) is performed by a previously bootstrapped
      endpoint whenever connecting to a network.  During discovery, the
      endpoint is instructed which privacy-enabling DNS protocol(s),
      port number(s), and IP addresses are supported on a local network.
      This effectively takes the place of DNS server IP address
      traditionally provided by IPv4 or IPv6 DHCP or by IPv6 Router
      Advertisement [RFC8106].

   o  Connection handshake and service invocation (Section 7): The DNS
      client initiates a (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server learned in
      the discovery phase, and validates the DNS server's identity using
      the credentials obtained in the bootstrapping phase.

   Note: The strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in
   [RFC8310] only applies to DNS-over-(D)TLS protocols, there has been
   no such distinction made for DNS-over-HTTPS protocol.

2.  Scope

   The problems discussed in Section 1 will be encountered in Enterprise
   networks.  Typically Enterprise networks do not assume that all
   devices in their network are managed by the IT team or Mobile Device
   Management (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common BYOD ("Bring
   Your Own Device") scenario.  The mechanisms specified in this
   document can be used by BYOD devices to discover and authenticate
   DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the Enterprise
   network.  This mechanism can also be used by IoT devices (managed by
   IT team) after onboarding to discover and authenticate DNS-
   over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the Enterprise
   network.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   (D)TLS is used for statements that apply to both Transport Layer
   Security [RFC8446] and Datagram Transport Layer Security [RFC6347].
   Specific terms are used for any statement that applies to either
   protocol alone.

   This document uses the terms defined in [RFC8499].

4.  Bootstrapping Endpoint Devices

   The following steps detail the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
   an endpoint with the local network's DNS server certificate:

   1.  The endpoint authenticates to the local network and discovers the
       Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] server using the
       procedure discussed in Section 8.

   2.  The endpoint establishes provisional TLS connection with that EST
       server, i.e., the endpoint provisionally accepts the unverified
       TLS server certificate.  However, the endpoint MUST authenticate
       the EST server before it accepts the DNS server certificate.  The
       endpoint either uses password-based authenticated key exchange
       (PAKE) with TLS 1.3 [I-D.barnes-tls-pake] as an authentication
       method or uses the mutual authentication protocol for HTTP
       [RFC8120] to authenticate the discovered EST server.

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery               June 2019


       As a reminder, PAKE is an authentication method that allows the
       use of usernames and passwords over unencrypted channels without
       revealing the passwords to an eavesdropper.  Similarly, the
       mutual authentication for HTTP is based on PAKE and provides
       mutual authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server
       using username and password as credentials.  The cryptographic
       algorithms to use with the mutual authentication protocol for
       HTTP are defined in [RFC8121].

   3.  The endpoint needs to use PAKE scheme to perform authentication
       the first time it connects to an EST server.  If the EST server
       authentication is successful, the server's identity can be used
       to authenticate subsequent TLS connections to that EST server.
       The endpoint configures the reference identifier for the EST
       server using the DNS-ID identifier type in the EST server
       certificate.  On subsequent connections to the EST server, the
       endpoint MUST validate the EST server certificate using the
       Implict Trust Anchor database (i.e, the EST server certificate
       must pass PKIX certification path validation) and match the
       reference identifier against the EST server's identity according
       to the rules specified in Section 6.4 of [RFC6125].

   4.  The endpoint learns the End-Entity certificates [RFC8295] from
       the EST server.  The certificate provisioned to the DNS server in
       the local network will be treated as a End-Entity certificate.
       As a reminder, the End-Entity certificates must be validated by
       the endpoint using an authorized trust anchor (Section 3.2 of
       [RFC8295]).  The endpoint needs to identify the certificate
       provisioned to the DNS server.  The SRV-ID identifier type
       [RFC6125] within subjectAltName entry MUST be used to identify
       the DNS server certificate.

       For example, DNS server certificate will include SRV-ID "_domain-
       s.example.net" along with DNS-ID "example.net".  The SRV service
       label "domain-s" is defined in Section 6 of [RFC7858].  As a
       reminder, the protocol component is not included in the SRV-ID
       [RFC4985].

   5.  The endpoint configures the authentication domain name (ADN)
       (defined in [RFC8310]) for the DNS server from the DNS-ID
       identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the DNS server
       certificate.  The DNS server certificate is associated with the
       ADN to be matched with the certificate given by the DNS server in
       (D)TLS.  To some extent, this approach is similar to certificate
       usage PKIX-EE(1) defined in [RFC7671].

   Figure 1 illustrates a sequence diagram for bootstrapping an endpoint
   with the local network's DNS server certificate.

5.  Bootstrapping IoT Devices

   The following steps explain the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
   IoT devices with local network's CA certificates and DNS server
   certificate:

   o  Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) discussed
      in [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] provides a solution for
      secure automated bootstrap of devices.  BRSKI specifies means to
      provision credentials on devices to be used to operationally
      access networks.  In addition, BRSKI provides an automated
      mechanism for the bootstrap distribution of CA certificates from
      the EST server.  The IoT device can use BRSKI to automatically
      bootstrap the IoT device using the IoT manufacturer provisioned
      X.509 certificate, in combination with a registrar provided by the

      local network and IoT device manufacturer's authorizing service
      (MASA):

      1.  The IoT device authenticates to the local network using the
          IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509 certificate.  The IoT
          device can request and get a voucher from the MASA service via
          the registrar.  The voucher is signed by the MASA service and
          includes the local network's CA public key.

      2.  The IoT device validates the signed voucher using the
          manufacturer installed trust anchor associated with the MASA,
          stores the CA's public key and validates the provisional TLS
          connection to the registrar.

      3.  The IoT device requests the full EST distribution of current
          CA certificates (Section 5.9.1 in
          [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]) from the registrar
          operating as a BRSKI-EST server.  The IoT devices stores the
          CA certificates as Explicit Trust Anchor database entries.
          The IoT device uses the Explicit Trust Anchor database to
          validate the DNS server certificate.

      4.  The IoT device learns the End-Entity certificates from the
          BRSKI-EST server.  The certificate provisioned to the DNS
          server in the local network will be treated as an End-Entity
          certificate.  The IoT device needs to identify the certificate
          provisioned to the DNS server.  The SRV-ID identifier type
          within subjectAltName entry MUST be used to identify the DNS
          server certificate.

      5.  The endpoint configures the ADN for the DNS server from the
          DNS-ID identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the DNS
          server certificate.  The DNS server certificate is associated
          with the ADN to be matched with the certificate given by the
          DNS server in (D)TLS.

6.  DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS Server Discovery Procedure

   A DNS client discovers the DNS server in the local network supporting
   DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols by using
   DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763].  DNS-SD provides
   generic solution for discovering services available in a local
   network.  DNS-SD defines a set of naming rules for certain DNS record
   types that they use for advertising and discovering services.
   Section 4.1 of [RFC6763] specifies that a service instance name in
   DNS-SD has the following structure:

   The <Domain> portion specifies the authentication domain name.  The
   <Service> portion of the DNS service instance name MUST be
   "_dprive._udp" or "_dprive._tcp" or "_doh._tcp".  If no DNS-SD
   records can be retrieved, the discovery procedure fails for this
   authentication domain name.  However, before retrying a lookup that
   has failed, a DNS client MUST wait a time period that is appropriate
   for the encountered error (e.g., NXDOMAIN, timeout, etc.).  If no
   DNS-SD records can be retrieved, the client can try connecting to the
   pre-configured public DNS servers.  If the endpoint has enabled
   strict privacy profile and access to the pre-configured public DNS
   servers is blocked, the DNS service won't be available to the
   endpoint and ultimately the endpoint cannot access Internet-reachable
   services.  If the endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile
   and access to the pre-configured public DNS servers is blocked, the
   endpoint will either fallback to an encrypted connection without
   authenticating the DNS server provided by the local network or
   fallback to clear text DNS.

   If DNS-over-HTTPS protocol is supported by the DNS server, the DNS
   client finds the URI template of the DNS-over-HTTPS server using the
   mechanism specified in [I-D.sah-resinfo-doh] to use the https URI
   scheme (Section 3 of [RFC8484]).

7.  Connection Handshake and Service Invocation

   The DNS client initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server, the
   DNS server presents its certificate in ServerHello message, and the
   DNS client MUST match the DNS server certificate downloaded in Step 4
   in Section 4 or Section 5 with the certificate provided by the DNS
   server in (D)TLS handshake.  If the match is successful, the DNS
   client MUST validate the server certificate using the Implicit Trust
   Anchor database (i.e., the DNS server certificate must pass PKIX
   certification path validation).

   If the match is successful and server certificate is successfully
   validated, the client continues with the connection as normal.
   Otherwise, the client MUST treat the server certificate validation
   failure as a non-recoverable error.  If the DNS client cannot reach
   or establish an authenticated and encrypted connection with the
   privacy-enabling DNS server provided by the local network, the DNS
   client can fallback to the privacy-enabling public DNS server.

8.  EST Service Discovery Procedure

   A EST client discovers the EST server in the local network by using
   DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763] or Multicast DNS
   (mDNS) [RFC6762].  The <Domain> portion specifies the DNS sub-domain
   where the service instance is registered.  It may be "local.",



Reddy, et al.           Expires December 16, 2019               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery               June 2019


   indicating the mDNS local domain, or it may be a conventional domain
   name such as "example.com.".  The <Service> portion of the EST
   service instance name MUST be "_est._tcp".

8.1.  mDNS

   A EST client application can proactively discover an EST server being
   advertised in the site by multicasting a PTR query to the following:

   o  "_est._tcp.local"

   A EST server can send out gratuitous multicast DNS answer packets
   whenever it starts up, wakes from sleep, or detects a change in EST
   server configuration.  EST client application can receive these
   gratuitous packets and cache information contained in them.

9.  Network Reattachment

   On subsequent attachments to the network, the endpoint discovers the
   privacy-enabling DNS server using the authentication domain name
   (configured in Step 5 of Section 4 or Section 5), initiates (D)TLS
   handshake with the DNS server and follows the mechanism discussed in
   Section 7 to validate the DNS server certificate.

   If the DNS server certificate is invalid (e.g., revoked or expired)
   or the procedure to discover the privacy-enabling DNS server fails
   (e.g.  the domain name of the privacy-enabling DNS server has changed
   because the Enterprise network has switched to a public privacy-
   enabling DNS server capable of blocking access to malicious domains),
   the endpoint discovers and initiates TLS handshake with the EST
   server, and uses the validation techniques described in [RFC6125] to
   compare the reference identifier (created in Step 2 of Section 4 in
   this document) to the EST server certificate and verifies the entire
   certification path as per [RFC5280].  The endpoint then gets the DNS
   server certificate from the EST server.  If the DNS-ID identifier
   type within subjectAltName entry in the DNS server certificate does
   not match the configured ADN, the ADN is replaced with the DNS-ID
   identifier type.  The DNS server certificate associated with the ADN
   is replaced with the one provided by the EST server.  If the ADN has
   changed, the endpoint discovers the privacy-enabling DNS server,
   initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server and follows the
   mechanism discussed in Section 7 to validate the DNS server
   certificate.

   Figure 2 illustrates a sequence diagram for re-configuring an
   endpoint with ADN and local network's DNS server certificate on
   subsequent attachments to the network.

                                the network

10.  Privacy Considerations

   [RFC7626] discusses DNS privacy considerations in both "on the wire"
   (Section 2.4 of [RFC7626]) and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of
   [RFC7626] contexts.  The endpoint may not know if the DNS-over-(D)TLS
   or DNS-over-HTTPS server in the local network has a privacy
   preserving data policy.  TODO can be used by the client to discover
   the privacy preserving data policy of the DNS server.

11.  Security Considerations

   The bootstrapping procedure to obtain the certificate of the local
   networks DNS server uses a client identity and password to
   authenticate the EST server using PAKE schemes.  Security
   considerations such as those discussed in [I-D.barnes-tls-pake] or
   [RFC8120] and [RFC8121] need to be taken into consideration.

   Users cannot be expected to enable or disable the bootstrapping or
   the discovery procedure as they switch networks.  Thus, it is



Reddy, et al.           Expires December 16, 2019              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery               June 2019


   RECOMMENDED that users indicate to their system in some way that they
   desire bootstrapping to be performed when connecting to a specific
   network, similar to the way users disable VPN connection in specific
   network (e.g., Enterprise network) and enable VPN connection by
   default in other networks.

   If an endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile, and the network
   security service blocks the traffic to the privacy-enabling public
   DNS server, a hard failure occurs and the user is notified.  The user
   has a choice to switch to another network or if the user trusts the
   network, the user can enable strict privacy profile with the DNS-
   over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS server discovered in the network
   instead of downgrading to opportunistic privacy profile.

   The primary attacks against the methods described in Section 6 are
   the ones that would lead to impersonation of a DNS server and
   spoofing the DNS response to indicate that the DNS server does not
   support any privacy-enabling protocols.  To protect against DNS-
   vectored attacks, secured DNS (DNSSEC) can be used to ensure the
   validity of the DNS records received.  Impersonation of the DNS
   server is prevented by validating the certificate presented by the
   DNS server.  If the EST server conveys the DNS server certificate,
   but the DNS-SD lookup indicates that the DNS server does not support
   any privacy-enabling protocols, the client can detect the DNS
   response is spoofed.

   Security considerations in [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
   need to be taken into consideration for IoT devices.

12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the SRV service name of "dprive" for
   DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-DTLS, and the service name of "doh" for DNS-
   over-HTTPS.

   IANA is requested to allocate the SRV service name of "est".
